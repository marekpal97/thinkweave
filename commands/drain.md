description: Drain a per-source-type acquisition queue. Source-type-agnostic — config in `vault/.mem/sources.yaml` decides whether items dispatch to a per-type research skill (sequential) or fan out to subagents (parallel).

# /drain — Per-source-type queue drainer

`/drain --source-type <slug>` walks `vault/.mem/queues/<source_type>.jsonl` FIFO and processes each item. The dispatch shape (sequential `Skill` call vs. parallel `Task` subagents) is driven by `vault/.mem/sources.yaml`, not by hard-coded source-type branches.

**Scope.** This skill *only* drains acquisition queues. Two former modes have moved out:

- Concept-hub backfill (synthesis, vault → vault, no queue) → use **`/update-hubs --bulk`**.
- One-shot retroactive Claude session import → use **`/onboard`** (or CLI `mem drain --source claude-history`).

---

## 1. Load config + queue

```
mem_sources_config()
```

The returned dict contains `sources.<slug>.*` keys you'll consult:

| Key | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `research_skill` | Per-type skill for sequential dispatch | `research-<slug>` |
| `subagent_type` | If set, fan out to `Task` subagents instead of `Skill` | `null` |
| `subagent_model` | `sonnet` / `opus` / null (inherit) | `null` |
| `drain_parallelism` | Max concurrent subagents per batch | `1` |
| `drain_batch_max` | Cap on items per drain run | `5` |
| `post_batch_hooks` | Hooks to run after fan-in (`dedup_sweep`, `theme_scan`) | `[]` |
| `dedup_window_hours` | Used by `dedup_sweep` | `24` |
| `dedup_jaccard_threshold` | Used by `dedup_sweep` | `0.8` |

```
mem_queue(action="peek", source_type="<slug>", n=<drain_batch_max>)
```

If empty → report "Nothing to drain." and stop. If `--limit N` was passed, use the smaller of N and `drain_batch_max`.

## 2. Dispatch — pick the path

### Path A: Sequential Skill dispatch (`subagent_type` not set)

This is the original behavior. Process items one at a time:

For each item:
1. `Skill(skill="<research_skill>", args="<url>")` — that skill handles fetch + summarize + concept mapping + `mem_create`.
2. On success: `mem_queue(action="archive", source_type="<slug>", item_id="<item-id>", status="done")`.
3. On non-recoverable failure: `mem_queue(action="archive", ..., status="failed")`. On recoverable failure: leave in place.

### Path B: Two-stage triage + writer fan-out (`subagent_type` is set)

The drain orchestrator runs Stage 1 (cheap Haiku triage on titles) once per drain, then spawns Sonnet writers (Stage 2) only for items that pass triage. Workers are no longer gatekeepers — admission is settled before they fire.

**Stage 1 — Haiku triage (single batched call, prompt-cached).**

Take up to `drain_batch_max` items off the queue (don't archive yet). Build a JSON list of `{id, title, outlet, tier}` for each. Then:

```bash
echo '<items_json>' | uv run python -m personal_mem.operations.news_triage \
    --themes <vault_root>/THEMES.md \
    --model claude-haiku-4-5
```

The triage helper reads the `## Catalog (active)` section of `THEMES.md` (placed there by `themes_ledger`), passes it as a cached system message to Haiku, and emits one verdict per input. Verdicts:

- `keep` — fits an active theme. Carries a `theme_id`.
- `keep_unfiled` — substantive but no theme match. `theme_id: null`. Goes to the periodic-review pile (frontmatter flag `theme_unfiled: true`).
- `drop` — noise. Archive directly.

**Stage 2 — Spawn writer subagents in parallel for `keep` and `keep_unfiled` items.**

For each kept item, in batches of `drain_parallelism`:

```
Task({
  subagent_type: "<subagent_type>",
  model: "<subagent_model>",
  description: "Write news brief: <short title>",
  prompt: "<queue item dict>\n\ntriage_verdict: <keep|keep_unfiled>\ntheme_id: <thm-X|null>\ntriage_reason: <reason>\n\nProcess this queue item end-to-end per your spec. Return a single-line JSON outcome as the final non-empty line of your response."
})
```

The writer's spec lives at `.claude/agents/research-news-worker.md`. It fetches the article, extracts ontology-gated concepts, writes the brief, and `mem_create`s the source note (filed under `relates_to: [theme_id]` if `keep`, or with `theme_unfiled: true` if `keep_unfiled`).

Collect each writer's final JSON line. Outcomes: `accepted` / `fetch_failed`. (Concept-bundle dedup, FOCUS gate, and Jaccard math are gone — the v1 mechanics no longer apply.)

**Archive the queue items based on outcomes:**

| Path | Triage verdict | Writer status | Archive |
|---|---|---|---|
| Triage drop | `drop` | (writer not spawned) | `status=rejected, reason="<triage reason>"` |
| Writer fetch fail | `keep` / `keep_unfiled` | `fetch_failed` | leave in queue (transient) |
| Writer success | `keep` | `accepted` | `status=done` |
| Writer success | `keep_unfiled` | `accepted` | `status=done` (note carries `theme_unfiled: true`) |

The reason field stamped at `vault/.mem/queues/_processed/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<source_type>.jsonl` carries the *triage reason* for drops, not a per-worker rejection — there is no per-worker rejection any more.

---

## 3. Post-batch hooks

Run each hook in the order declared in `post_batch_hooks`. Note: hooks run **once per drain invocation**, not per fan-out batch.

### `theme_scan` — float new theme candidates from the unfiled pile

The triage stage emits `keep_unfiled` for items with substantive signal but no theme match. Those notes carry `theme_unfiled: true` in frontmatter. After the batch closes, scan for clusters across the unfiled pile (≥3 notes sharing ≥2 concepts) — the same deterministic clustering used elsewhere, restricted to unfiled news:

```
Bash("uv run mem themes scan-candidates --source-type <slug>")
```

The scan is deterministic and fast. Candidates land at `vault/themes/_candidates/cand-XXXX-*.md` and are promoted via `/themes-resolve --promote <cand-id> [--parent thm-Y]`. Once promoted, a follow-up step links accumulated unfiled notes whose concept overlap matches the new theme's `concepts:`.

Output is a candidate-creation count; surface it in the final summary.

> **Removed: `dedup_sweep`.** v1 had a Jaccard-based within-batch dedup hook to catch race-condition near-dupes from parallel workers all calling `mem_search` at the same instant. v2's writers don't dedup at all — duplicate news on an unfolding event is itself signal (multiple sources confirming the same arc). Cross-source repetition lands in a single theme's catalyst log; the user reads breadth there, not in dedup-marked supersedes.

## 4. Report

For Path B (news):

```
Drain summary for queue '<slug>' (path=B, two-stage):
  Triage:    K kept (<L theme-attached, M unfiled>) / N drop / 0 errors
  Writers:   <accepted> ⇒ <src-IDs, max 8 then ellipsis>
  Fetch failed: <count> (left in queue)
  Post-batch theme_scan: <new candidates>
  Remaining: <queue size>
```

For Path A (paper / repo / article):

```
Drain summary for queue '<slug>' (path=A):
  Drained: N / M items
  Accepted: <count> ⇒ <src-IDs>
  Failed: <count>
  Remaining: <queue size>
```

---

## When to use which path

| Path | Used by | Why |
|---|---|---|
| A (Skill) | paper, repo, article | Per-item compute is small (one URL fetch + concept extract). Sequential is fine. |
| B (Triage + writer) | news | Title-only Haiku triage decides admission (cheap, batched, prompt-cached); Sonnet writers fan out only on accepts. The two-stage shape decouples gate cost (~$0.005/batch) from per-item brief cost (~$0.10/accept). |

Adding a source type to path B requires:
1. A writer subagent at `.claude/agents/research-<slug>-worker.md` (writer-only — no gating).
2. `subagent_type` + `subagent_model` + `drain_parallelism` + `triage_model` set in `vault/.mem/sources.yaml`.
3. The triage helper (currently news-specific in `operations/news_triage.py`) generalised — when we get there, the catalog source is the natural axis (themes for news, ontology for papers, repo languages for repos…).

No changes to this skill.
